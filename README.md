# Interact
Interact is a scientific software designed for the analysis of 1D and 2D NMR titration experiments.

Interact i) performs peak picking and spectra annotation, ii) process each signal of interest in each experiment to
extract different parameters (chemical shifts, linewidths, intensity, angle), and iii) integrates the results of the
different experiments to infer thermodynamic, kinetic or structural information on the system under study.

Interact documentation can be found in "Tutorial.pdf".
